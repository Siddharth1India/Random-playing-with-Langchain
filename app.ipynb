    "2. Human Chat Message\n",

    "**__PRO_TIP__**: While making product, try to keep Human chat as low as possible because normal users are very bad at writing prompt and model give pretty bad results with bad prompts which will results into you replying to useless complaint emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than that, one important thing I need to explain.\n",
    "    - Our daily usage is when we use model with zero-shot learning but model give outstanding result when it is trained with some examples, usually known as few-shot learning. We use method of `Examples` for this where we provide model with input/output pairs so model can better understand what we are expecting. "
