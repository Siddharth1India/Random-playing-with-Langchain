# LangChain
This repo is made and maintained by [me](https://twitter.com/Siddharth1India) for reference of my team. This is just standard methods of usage of things and should not be taken as standard project. I am just playing with LangChain docs here.

**__NOTE__**: Most part is directly taken from [LangChain official documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) and I compiled this notebook so my team can find whatever they need directly from here.
